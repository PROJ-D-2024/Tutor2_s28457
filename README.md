The purpose of this project is to clean and standardize a dataset in preparation for the analysis and modeling required for my future thesis project. This involves selecting a relevant dataset, performing data cleaning (handling missing values, removing duplicates, addressing outliers), and standardizing the data to ensure consistency. The goal is to create a reproducible data preprocessing workflow.

Technologies Used
MongoDB: Used as the primary database for storing and managing the dataset.
Python: Used for scripting and executing data cleaning and preprocessing tasks.
MongoDB Compass: Used for connecting to MongoDB, exploring, and managing data.
Git and GitHub: Used for version control to ensure reproducibility and collaboration.
